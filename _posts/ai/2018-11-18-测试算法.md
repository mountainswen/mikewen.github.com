TOML
====

Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language.

By Tom Preston-Werner.

Latest tagged version:
[v0.5.0](https://github.com/mojombo/toml/blob/master/versions/en/toml-v0.5.0.md).

NOTE: The `master` branch of this repository tracks the very latest development
and may contain features and changes that do not exist on any released version.
To find the spec for a specific version, look in the `versions` subdirectory.

As of version 0.5.0, TOML should be considered extremely stable. The goal is for
version 1.0.0 to be backwards compatible (as much as humanly possible) with
version 0.5.0. All implementations are strongly encouraged to become 0.5.0
compatible so that the transition to 1.0.0 will be simple when that happens.

Objectives
----------

TOML aims to be a minimal configuration file format that's easy to read due to
obvious semantics. TOML is designed to map unambiguously to a hash table. TOML
should be easy to parse into data structures in a wide variety of languages.
